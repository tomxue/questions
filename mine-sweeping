Purpose: To know which questions I had studied, to give the key word of the answer in Scrapbook, to exercise English...


Q: What is the effect of assert on Aggy? 
A: The display turns to black for a while, and then turns to white, then normal.

Q: Why Aggy could not be flashed?
A: RDC is a key factor, it should be flashed first.

Q: What is the difference between interrupt gate and trap gate?
A: interrupt gate is to catch interrupt; trap gate is to catch exception.

Q: How to append new content to existing file?
A: for example, cat "hello new line" >> existing_file
	
Q: How to send email in Linux?
A: mailx & mutt, refer to scrapbook

Q: How to input/show Chinese characters in Linux?
A: IBus and gvim, refer to scrapbook

Q: Where to download vim plug-in? How to install the vim plug-in?
A: From the website http://www.vim.org/scripts, you can find all the vim plug-in. c-support.vim was installed, refer to its README about installation.

Q: How to reserve the space key in the Linux shell script?
A: By using like: echo "$VAR"

Q: What is your sentiment from game WinMine?
A: To solve problem is like WinMine, kick off a start, and then meet new problem, solve it, go ahead, meet more problems...at last, a big area appears.

Q: How to self-protect in an earthquake?
A: To select the small space, e.g. kitchen, toilet, or where can form triangle space; keep clearance from the door, window and balcony; when start quaking, turn off the heat and open the door; keep clearance from the precast concrete wall and doorpost...  

Q: What is BOM? And why do we need it?
A: It is byte-order mark, used to mark the encoding type of unicode file.

Q: What is LILO and GRUB? Where are they stored? And what is the difference between them?
A: They are both boot loader. 
BIOS -> MBR:512 Bytes(IPL: initial program loader + Partition Table) -> secondary boot loader.
(1) GRUB is more powerful and flexible than LILO. 
(2) LILO has no interactive command interface, but GRUB has. 
(3) LILO does not support boot from network, but GRUB does. 
(4) LILO stores the OS position info into MBR, so if we modify LILO, we need to rewrite the IPL into MBR again. This is unsafe, and GRUB does not do so. GRUB will switch to a command interface if its configuration file is wrong, and user could boot OS manually.

Q: How to use gparted?
A: To install gparted, run the command: sudo apt-get install gparted. gparted is like PQmagic of Windows and it is quite easy to use. 	

Q: How to use mke2fs?
A:
(1) check where the u-disk is mounted 
(2) umount it 
(3) mke2fs /dev/sdb1 
(4) mount it to some path, e.g. sudo mount /8G_Flash /dev/sdb1

Q: What is fsck command? How to use it?
A: fsck is to check and repair a Linux file system. E.g. sudo fsck -t ext3 /dev/sda3, and remember that before fsck, sudo umount /dev/sda3

Q: How to apply lilo.conf?
A: LILO is LInux LOader. LILO can be installed into MBR or Linux root partition. User can modify /etc/lilo.conf to control LILO. For example,
boot = /dev/hda
vga = normal
read-only
prompt
default = dos
timeout = 30
append="hdc=ide-scsi"
image = /boot/vmlinuz
label = linux
root = /dev/hda2
initrd = /boot/initrd 

Any change of lilo.conf, upgrade of kernel or reconstruction of initrd, user should run /sbin/lilo again to make LILO to be written into the partition.

Q: What kinds of Linux Desktop Environment do we have?
A: KDE, Gnome, Xfce, LXDE, etc.
(1) KDE is earliest, originated by Lynx' inventor, and it owns KOffice. 
(2) Gnome focuses on internationalization. 
(3) Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment, and its target is to improve the system efficiency. The main feature of Xfce is that it can be easily configed, and it has a window manager called XFwm. 
(4) LXDE is developed mainly by Taiwan guys, and its main feature is to be pragmatic, light and handy. In addition, LXDE can be run in very old machine, e.g. produced in 1999.

Q: What is class library?
A: e.g. MFC, VCL, STL

Q: What is VCL?
A: Visual Component Library, it is the basic class library of Delphi, C++ Builder. And it is platform independence, e.g. Windows, Linux, MacOS.

Q: What is EJB?
A: Enterprise JavaBeans (EJB) technology is the server-side component architecture for Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE). EJB technology enables rapid and simplified development of distributed, transactional, secure and portable applications based on Java technology.

Q: What is the difference between Frame Buffer and X?
A: 
(1) X is a protocol, and it has X server and X client. X client requests to draw, and X server draws it.
(2) FrameBuffer is a driver interface, and it abstracts the display as frame buffer. User can regard it as the image of display memory. And after mmap to the user space, user can operate it directly.

Q: What is the difference of single quotes, double quotes and backticks?
A: 
(1) When shell meets the first single quote, it will ignore all the special symbol untill it meets the second single quote.
(2) Shell won't ignore 3 symbols, they are $, \, `.
(3) The backticks are for shell command replacement.

Q: What is the difference between source and exec commands?
A: exec will close current shell, and then continue to execute the later commands. And source command will execute in current shell but will not close it.

Q: What is the difference between pointer array and array pointer?
A: pointer array is an array pointers, array pointer is a pointer to an array.

Q: What is the difference between function pointer and pointer function?
A: 
(1) function pointer is for example, int (*f)(int x); It means a pointer points a function. The type of the function's return value must be same as the function pointer's type, e.g. int here. And user can invoke the function by *f.
(2) pointer function is for example, int *f(xï¼Œy); The function will return a pointer, and the pointer points to an interger.

Q: What is thread pool? What is its purpose?
A: Thread pool means there are some created threads, and they are in the free waiting state in the beginning. When there is new task, a free thread will be picked up to handle the task. And after finish, the thread will return to the thread pool to wait for new task.
The benefit of thread pool is the reuse of thread, no need to destroy and recreate a thread.

Q: How to make a size limited directory in Linux?
A: 
dd if=/dev/zero of=/home/test.img bs=1M count=1024
losetup /dev/loop1 /home/test.img
mkfs.ext4 /dev/loop1
mount /dev/loop1 ~/limitedDir

Q: What is loop device?
A: It can associate a file with a file system. It can be formatted and mounted.

Q: What is STL?
A: STL is Standard Template Library, it is for reusability and its design philosophy is generic programming. And it is like the case of MFC and VCL.

Q: What is EJB?
A: EJB is Enterprise JavaBean.
