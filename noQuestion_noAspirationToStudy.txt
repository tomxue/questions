Q: What is BOM? And why do we need it?

Q: What is LILO and GRUB? Where are they stored? And what is the difference between them?
A: They are both boot loader. 
BIOS -> MBR:512 Bytes(IPL: initial program loader + Partition Table) -> secondary boot loader.
(1) GRUB is more powerful and flexible than LILO. (2) LILO has no interactive command interface, but GRUB has. (3) LILO does not support boot from network, but GRUB does. (4) LILO stores the OS position info into MBR, so if we modify LILO, we need to rewrite the IPL into MBR again. This is unsafe, and GRUB does not do so. GRUB will switch to a command interface if its configuration file is wrong, and user could boot OS manually.

Q: How to use fdisk/gparted?
A: To install gparted, run the command: sudo apt-get install gparted. gparted is like PQmagic of Windows and it is quite easy to use.
