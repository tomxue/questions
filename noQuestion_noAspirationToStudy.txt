Q: What is BOM? And why do we need it?
A: It is byte-order mark, used to mark the encoding type of unicode file.

Q: What is LILO and GRUB? Where are they stored? And what is the difference between them?
A: They are both boot loader. 
BIOS -> MBR:512 Bytes(IPL: initial program loader + Partition Table) -> secondary boot loader.
(1) GRUB is more powerful and flexible than LILO. (2) LILO has no interactive command interface, but GRUB has. (3) LILO does not support boot from network, but GRUB does. (4) LILO stores the OS position info into MBR, so if we modify LILO, we need to rewrite the IPL into MBR again. This is unsafe, and GRUB does not do so. GRUB will switch to a command interface if its configuration file is wrong, and user could boot OS manually.

Q: How to use gparted?
A: To install gparted, run the command: sudo apt-get install gparted. gparted is like PQmagic of Windows and it is quite easy to use. 	

Q: How to use mke2fs?

Q: What is fsck command? How to use it?
A: fsck is to check and repair a Linux file system. E.g. sudo fsck -t ext3 /dev/sda3, and remember that before fsck, sudo umount /dev/sda3

Q: How to apply lilo.conf?
A: LILO is LInux LOader. LILO can be installed into MBR or Linux root partition. User can modify /etc/lilo.conf to control LILO. For example,
boot = /dev/hda
vga = normal
read-only
prompt
default = dos
timeout = 30
append="hdc=ide-scsi"
image = /boot/vmlinuz
label = linux
root = /dev/hda2
initrd = /boot/initrd 

Any change of lilo.conf, upgrade of kernel or reconstruction of initrd, user should run /sbin/lilo again to make LILO to be written into the partition.
